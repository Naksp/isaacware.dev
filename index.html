                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I'm a software engineer with experience in web development and some light game development.
                        I'm a graduate of the University of Wisconsin - Madison with a B.S. in Computer Science, and am currently looking for a job in the Midwest.
                        I have an affinity for solving tricky problems, and love learning new things.
                        My greatest passions are music &mdash; I've been playing drums for over fifteen years, and I'm currently attempting to learn guitar &mdash; running, baking, and photography.</p>
